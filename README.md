# Biz Ville
## Shop local, shop Biz Ville

## Inspiration
Almost 3 years ago, the covid 19 pandemic first hit Canada. Needless to say, it impacted millions of lives, posing considerable damage to all aspects of daily life, the economy and society. One, in particular, was the grave impact on local businesses in our local community. Small businesses have always had a difficult time marketing themselves and making a profit as big corporations are often more popular. And, as the world digitizes, many small business owners continue to struggle. Conversely, as people try to reduce their carbon footprint, an important method is shopping locally. However, it has been a difficult time finding local businesses. Addressing these two issues, our website - Biz Ville - is an online portal of small businesses, sorted with its corresponding categories. 
 
## What it does
Biz Ville is a platform for small businesses within a city to connect with its local citizens. As an online platform for small businesses, they have an opportunity for marketing while users have the opportunity to buy locally with ease. 
 
## How we built it
Biz Ville is built using HTML, CSS, and Javascript to build the website, and Figma to build the icons and pictures. 
 
## Challenges we ran into
We, unfortunately, could not finish this project, as a result of repl.itâ€™s RAM limitations. We also ran into a lot of difficulties, due to an unfamiliarity with the coding language.
 
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Prior to today, we knew nothing about HTML, CSS, and Javascript, but through perseverance, dedication, open-mindedness and sheer willpower, we were able to move a button to the right side of the screen. We would like to thank everyone at hack::peel for providing us with the opportunity to get this far. (Also, thank you to Sticker Giant for the cute stickers!)
 
## What we learned
We learned how to use HTML and CSS (not really javascript) to create buttons, search bars, and fillable forms, as well as make a picture background on a website.
We also learned to collaboratively work on a project as we discussed, brainstormed, and worked together. We used each of our unique strengths and skills to divide and conquer the task at hand. Throughout this process, we also were able to work on leadership, social and networking skills as we interacted with other competitors as well. 
 
## What's next for Biz Ville
Biz Ville aspires to be the number one used small business web application in North America. Our first priority is to finish the front and back-end development so our website functions smoothly. Currently, we have a 2-dimensional user interface, but we wish to eventually upgrade to 3-dimensional for a better user experience. We also wish to expand our map to cover more categories of small businesses as well as expand our demographic to small businesses around North America.
